		<p>Samwise "Sam" Gamgee (6 April <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Third_Age">T.A. </a> <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Third_Age_2980">2980</a> - Fo.A. 61; Shire Reckoning: 1380 - 1482; 102 years old when he sailed into the West) was Frodo Baggins' servant and the only original member of the Fellowship of the Ring to remain with him till the very end of the journey to Mount Doom. </p>

		<p>Sam was Frodo's gardener. He was drawn into Frodo's adventure while eavesdropping on a private conversation Frodo was having with the wizard Gandalf.</p>

		<p>Samwise means "simple minded" or "half-minded". Gamgee is explained as a corruption of the name <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gammidgy">Gammidgy</a>, a village in the Shire. Both names are presented as translations of the Westron form of Sam's name Banazîr Galbasi (also spelled Banazîr Galpsi) (q.v. for more information).</p>
