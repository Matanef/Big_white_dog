#     print(emptyString)

# number = float(6)
# print(number)

# a float is a number including the decimel point



# ok so i seem to have a problem here, i'm trying to create a loop that will add i which is 1 in this case to the new list and that will check, if the list length is equal to i another 0.5 will be 
# added to it but i can't make it.

# i saw we can do this with importing numpy but this there's got to be a way to do this with loops.
# i will ask put a list of problems and will ask them all together and not 1 by one.
