let x = 5

// if (x > y) {

//i'll do it again:

if (x > y) {
	console.log(`X equals to ${x} and Y is equal to ${y} which means that Y is bigger then X, this is the if`)
} else if (x < y) {
	console.log(`X equals to ${x} and Y is equal to ${y} which means that Y is bigger then X, this is the else if,`)
} else {
	console.log("they are equal");
