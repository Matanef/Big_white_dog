5 + "34"
// Prediction: 534, first is a number but the 34 is a string and 
//as we saw in the last exercise once adding a string to a 
//number is will attach it directly next to the first value that was written.
// Actual:

5 - "4"
// Prediction:here it's a bit different since we are subtracting.
//well i guess that it's going to be 1 but don't really know why.
// Actual:

10 % 5
// Prediction: not sure here if the intent was for us to devide 10 by 5.
//if so it should print 2, but if JS uses the same signs for math
//problems i'm not sure that this was actually the intent so not sure 
//regarding the result
// Actual: the result was 0, it looks like the % sing will only 
// present some information.
//for example in this on we received the result 0 because in most 
//instances that i ws able to check the % sign print the last number
// that comes infront of it.

5 % 10
// Prediction: so after the previous one (10 % 5) this will present 5
// Actual:5
// i did played with it abit and noticed for example:
// 132 % 20 will present 12
// 1245623247 % 90 will present 27

"Java" + "Script"
// Prediction:JavaScript
// Actual:JavaScript
