	<p>Hello Everyone, Congratulation on your first day of coding at DevelopersInstitute - this is a p element outside of div</p>

		<p>Hello Everyone, Congratulation on your first day of coding at DevelopersInstitute - this is a p element inside div</p>
	</div>
	<p style="text-align: left;">So here we can see that i used inline for the p element and another inline for the div p one.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Although the p element is defined with text color "darkred" the text color of the p inside the div is different.</p>


<p>After applying inline adjustment, i <span class="a">created</span> a *.css file and linked it to the file.</p>
<p>I was able to see that the inline takes priority over the css file, since while the css file is linked no changes that were writen inthe file can be seen. once removing the inline design the changes in the file were visible.</p>


<span class="b"></span><span class="c"></span><span class="d"></span>

        <li>What is Lorem Ipsum?</li>
        <li>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, </li>
       <li>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,</p>
    <ol>
        <li> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets </li>
    </ol>
    <p> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
